FlashWebDriver
==============
Greetings,

This is what I worked on so far.


I used Flash Selenium.Java-client-extension.jar to call common methods for example Play, Stop, etc using Selenium RC.

FlashSelenium -is the component that enables Selenium RC Java Client to talk to flash.

Problem ----
Selenium RC is the older version to Selenium WebDriver. 
 Selenium RC- need to start the server and stop the server whenever we run a script. 
Selenium RC is also depreciated.  


Solution--- 
FlashSelenium.extension and created a class Flex-WebDriver to call our generic function using the Selenium WebDriver.
